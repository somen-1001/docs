## RESTful API Design

### Introduction to REST

The SPARQ API is designed around the REST architectural style, leveraging HTTP verbs familiar to web clients. This section introduces the fundamental concepts necessary for interacting with the SPARQ API.

### HTTP Verbs

| Verb      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| GET      | Retrieve data from the SPARQ server.       |
| POST   | Submit data to the SPARQ server, creating or updating resources.        |
| PUT   | Update resources on the SPARQ server.        |
| DELETE   | Remove resources from the SPARQ server.        |


## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support

SPARQ supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), enabling developers to seamlessly integrate and interact with the SPARQ API directly from their applications, regardless of the domain from which the application is served.
